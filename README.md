# ProxiHeat

## Inspiration
It's getting cold outside and gas prices are on the rise. How can we avoid needlessly wasting energy when we don't need to?
ProxiHeat is a further step toward innovative heating optimization without a significant time investment required by users.

## What it does
ProxiHeat detects users' proximity to radiators throughout the day using their device's Bluetooth signals and activates radiators based on the current proximity of users as well as historical proximity data.

## How we built it
- RaspberryPi as a Bluetooth sensor
- NestJS Backend for coordinating the sensor data and keeping track of historical data
- React Forntend for more insight into the system

## Challenges we ran into
Detecting and recording the intensity of Bluetooth signals using a Raspberry Pi.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Good teamwork once we decided on an idea that we liked.

## What we learned
Time flies when you're trying to debug headless embedded systems.
